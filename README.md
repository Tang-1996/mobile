# Mobile App
React Native codebase that produces the UniNinja iOS and Android applications.

### Installation

In order to build and run the application, do the following:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/UniNinja/mobile`.
2. Change directory to the project root: `cd mobile`.
2. Run `npm i` in the repo directory. This may take a few minutes.
3. Then execute either `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to run the respective projects.

> #### Important
> If you have not already got `react-native` installed on your system, you will first need to do so using: `npm install -g react-native-cli`.

> When running the Android project on a Mac, make sure you launch the Android Emulator _before_ you run the `react-native run-android`.
